**POW Summit 2023** is a unique conference which brings the major [Proof of Work (POW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) communities together around our common cause.  After Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (POS), the mainstream narrative is that POW is an environmentally unfriendly and obsolete technology with no redeeming qualities.

This conference highlights the unique benefits of POW and related cypherpunk topics:

- • Why maximal decentralization is so important
- • Censorship resistance and avoidance of capture
- • Privacy technology
- • POW environmental sustainability (POW can be carbon-negative)

There will be many well-known keynote speakers with a distinct OG flavor, together with a strong slate of speakers from each of the participating POW projects (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, Monero and ZCash).

These overarching themes are accessible for all audiences.  They are not unique to miners, or developers, or to end-users.  They are universal and hugely important.  We want to take attendees back to basics - explaining the pre-Bitcoin landscape, talking through cypherpunk origins, the [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars) and encryption-as-a-munition, Napster, Bitgold, b-money, and then the birth of Bitcoin and POW.

We will explain why these fundamentals are still so important in 2022.

There have been mining conferences.  There have been plenty of Bitcoin-only conferences, but to our knowledge there has never been a pluralist conference with an overarching focus on POW and on blockchain fundamentals.   The vast majority of people in the blockchain ecosystem were not around in the early days and have likely never heard the origin stories.

We aim to attract around 500 attendees, with sponsors from the mining world, Bitcoin service companies, and from companies involved in the ecosystems of the collaborating POW projects.  This is not a profit-making enterprise.  Sponsorship is just intended to offset costs for the speakers and the organization - and especially so that we can pay keynote speakers who require speaking fees.

The event is organized by [MMH Group](https://mmhgroup.io) under contract to the [ETC Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org), in partnership with the [Litecoin Foundation](https://www.litecoin.net/).
