# MoneroKon { .parent-scroll-element #monerokon}

Monero Konferenco is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks, scientists, and philosophers and is designed to disseminate scientific and technical results in privacy and financial technologies like censorship-resistant digital cash. The event is funded by generous donations from the Monero community and support from sponsors. Come participate in discussions, make a proposal, and help us move privacy forward one conversation at a time. A cashless society lacking basic financial privacy can not remain an open society for long.

POW Summit is co-located with [MoneroKon](https://monerokon.com) in La Fabrika.  MoneroKon runs from Friday 23rd June to Sunday 25th June 2023.  There is an evening event for MoneroKon on that same Sunday and then POW Summit is happening on Monday 26th and Tuesday 27th June.

We hope to cross-promote and collaborate with MoneroKon as much as possible.
